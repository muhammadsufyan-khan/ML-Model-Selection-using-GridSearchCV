# ML-Model-Selection-using-GridSearchCV

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to compare multiple machine learning models
(Logistic Regression and Random Forest) and select the best model
using GridSearchCV based on F1-score.


## 🧠 Methodology
1. Load and preprocess dataset
2. Build a pipeline with preprocessing and classifier
3. Apply GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
4. Evaluate models using Accuracy and F1 Score
5. Select the best-performing model



## 📊 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier



## 🏆 Results
- Best Model selected via GridSearchCV
- Achieved high F1-score and accuracy
- Random Forest performed better in most cases
